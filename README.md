# Coach Task Tracker

A dual-role web application for managing coaching tasks. Admins assign tasks with deadlines to coaches, coaches get auto-nudged as deadlines approach, and can mark completion or submit delay reasons.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm

### Setup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm install

# Setup environment variables (create .env file):
# JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
# GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...  (get free key at https://console.groq.com, no credit card needed)
# COACHING_INSIGHTS_ENABLED=true (optional, for Phase 7 multi-agent coaching)

echo "JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here" > .env
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YOUR_KEY_HERE" >> .env
node index.js
```
Runs on http://localhost:3001

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs on http://localhost:5173

### Default Login
- Email: `admin@tracker.com`
- Password: `admin123`

### Knowledge Graph (Graphify)

Graphify automatically indexes your codebase into a queryable knowledge graph.

**First time? Generate the graph locally:**
```bash
pip install graphifyy
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."  # or OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY
graphify extract . --out .graphify
```

**Then query it in future sessions:**
```bash
graphify query "How do coaches get notified?"
graphify path "coach" "notification"
graphify explain "midpoint_nudge"
```

Graph outputs auto-rebuild on commit (git hooks installed). See [@docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#knowledge-graph-graphify) for details.

## Features

### Admin
- Create and manage coaches
- Assign tasks with priority and deadline (single or multiple coaches)
- Multi-coach assignment: assign one task to several coaches with individual notifications
- View all task progress
- Read delay reasons from coaches
- Get notifications when tasks complete or are overdue

### Coach
- View assigned tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Submit delay reasons for overdue tasks
- Get auto-nudged at task midpoint
- Get overdue notifications

### Automated
- **Midpoint nudge**: Coach notified when 50% of task time has elapsed
- **Overdue nudge**: Coach notified and admin alerted when task is past due
- **Coaching tone**: All messages encourage growth and accountability
- **Multi-Agent Coaching Insights** (Phase 7): Groq API-powered 3-agent consensus swarm analyzes coach behavior patterns on task completion/delay submission. No cost, fire-and-forget, never blocks UX.

## Development (Superpowers Framework)

This project uses the **Superpowers** methodology from https://github.com/obra/superpowers.

### Full Superpowers Integration

All 14 superpowers skills are installed in `.claude/skills/`:

**Methodology skills:**
- `/using-superpowers` ← **START HERE**
- `/brainstorming` — Explore requirements
- `/writing-plans` — Design implementation
- `/test-driven-development` — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- `/subagent-driven-development` — Execute with agents
- `/verification-before-completion` — Verify before claiming done
- `/requesting-code-review` — Request structured review
- `/receiving-code-review` — Handle feedback rigorously
- `/systematic-debugging` — Root-cause analysis
- `/dispatching-parallel-agents` — Parallel execution
- `/using-git-worktrees` — Isolated workspaces
- `/finishing-a-development-branch` — Branch completion
- `/executing-plans` — Execute written plans
- `/writing-skills` — Create custom skills

**Project-specific skills:**
- `/skill-auth`, `/skill-db`, `/skill-api`, `/skill-frontend`, `/skill-notifications`, `/skill-cron`, `/skill-testing`

### To Build a Feature

1. `/using-superpowers` — Understand the framework (5 min)
2. `/brainstorming` — Explore requirements
3. `/writing-plans` — Design multi-step tasks
4. `/test-driven-development` — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
5. `/verification-before-completion` — Verify before done
6. `/requesting-code-review` — Get structured review

### Code Conventions

- **No comments** unless WHY is non-obvious
- **Validate at boundaries** — only at user input, external APIs
- **Admin routes** — wrap with `requireAdmin` middleware
- **Coach routes** — verify `req.user.id` matches resource owner
- **Notifications** — always check idempotency (no double-nudge)
- **Tests** — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, use real SQLite (see `/skill-testing`)

See [@docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.

## Architecture

**Why SQLite?** Single-machine deployment, zero infra. Sufficient for <1000 tasks.

**Why JWT?** Stateless auth, role embedded in token, no session store needed.

**Why node-cron?** Avoids Redis/queue complexity. Nudge jobs are idempotent and safe to re-run.

**Why polling (30s)?** Simple, notifications aren't real-time critical.

See [@docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full design rationale.

---

## Debugging

⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE:** If all API endpoints return 500 errors, see [@docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the quick fix (usually just stuck Node processes).

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **All APIs return 500 (but code works)** | **Run `scripts/cleanup.cmd` — old Node processes on port 3001** |
| **Port 3001 already in use** | **Run `scripts/cleanup.cmd` to kill stuck processes** |
| Backend won't start | `.env` has `JWT_SECRET`, `npm install` ran |
| Frontend won't connect | Backend on 3001, Vite proxy in `vite.config.js` |
| Notifications not showing | Table has rows, bell polls every 30s |
| Cron not running | `cron.js` imported in `index.js`, schedule set |

**Quick Fix for "All APIs Return 500":**
```bash
# Windows
scripts\cleanup.cmd

# Linux/Mac
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

Then start fresh servers in **two new terminal windows**:
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd server && node index.js

# Terminal 2
cd client && npm run dev
```

See [@docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed troubleshooting, prevention strategies, and diagnostic tools.
